# alfred-CensusQuickRef
An [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) Workflow to query and make calculations on demographic data, with a function to calculate carriers if odds ratio, disease, and minor allele frequency are provided.

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation ✅</h1>

- Being able to quickly answer questions like: 
	- *how many people between xx and xx years of age live in [US/World/Europe/this-country]*
	- *if a disease has a prevalence of 3:100,000 how many cases are there in [US/US state/World/Europe/this-country]*
	- *if a risk factor has OR = 2, and a frequency y, how many carrier cases and controls can we expect for a disease with prevalence x?*




<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up ⚙️</h1>

### Needed
- [Alfred 5](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with Powerpack license


<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage 📖</h1>

- Launch with keyword (default: `!p`) or hotkey.
- Enter characters below to subset the total population based on %, age, sex, US state, ancestry. 
- ↩️ will copy the current row to clipboard 
- ^↩️ will copy the current row to clipboard and paste to frontmost application
- ⌘↩️ will copy entire output to clipboard and paste to frontmost application

## Subsets 🔣 (World regions, or individual country)

### Slice 🍰
- `%` percent of the population
- `1:` frequency per 100,000

### Age 🧙
- `nn` exact age
- `nn+` some age and above
- `nn-` some age and below
- `nn-nn` some age range


## Other criteria (🇺🇸 only)
### Sex ♂️♀️ 
- `M` male
- `F` female


### US state 🇺🇸
- `XX` US state abbreviation

### Ancestry 👤
- `EUR` European
- `AMR` American Indian
- `AAA` African-American
- `ASI` Asian

- `H` Hispanic (can be alone or added to any of the above)


## Calculating the number of expected carriers 🧮
- `ORxx` OR (Odds Ratio) followed by a number
- `MAFxx` MAF (Minor allele frequency), followed by a number
- `DISxx` Disease frequency, followed by a number
- Note: `OR`, `MAF`, and `DIS` are case-sensitive


<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & known issues ⚠️</h1>

- None for now, but I have not done extensive testing, let me know if you see anything!
- The carrier estimate is just a rough estimate and makes a number of assumptions and approximations.

<h1 id="changelog">Changelog 🧰</h1>

- 2026-08-09: version 0.1.3, code review — fixed a crash on any query that returned no rows (the "No matches" message threw an `UnboundLocalError` instead of showing); guarded an empty query (was an `IndexError`); fixed `N+` age queries undercounting the World/region figures (they excluded the boundary age and everyone 88+, so e.g. *20+* dropped ~3% of the world population); corrected a mislabeled disease-prevalence tag
- 05-19-2023: version 0.1
